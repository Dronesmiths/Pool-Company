# AI Pilots: Newsletter & Hub Strategy

This document defines how to build and maintain the "Pulse" of the brand through a dedicated Newsletter Hub.

## 1. The Newsletter Hub (`/news/`)
Create a central hub that lists all updates, project spotlights, and guides.
- **File**: `/news/index.html`
- **Layout**: Use a card-grid similar to the Homepage services, but optimized for text summaries and "Read More" links.
- **CTA**: Every page must have a "Join the Community" email capture/link.

## 2. The Deployment Workflow
To ensure a consistent rollout from the 50-post [CONTENT_QUEUE.md](CONTENT_QUEUE.md):

1. **Pick the Next Item**: Look at the first unchecked item in the queue.
2. **Draft Content**: Use the [BRAND_GUIDE.md](BRAND_GUIDE.md) and [SEO_ROADMAP.md](SEO_ROADMAP.md) to generate the HTML.
3. **Create the Page**: Place in `/news/[slug]/index.html`.
4. **Update the Hub**: Add a new preview card to `/news/index.html` (Newest first).
5. **Check & Deploy**: Mark completion in `CONTENT_QUEUE.md` and run the standard sync.

## 3. Cornerstone Linkage
Every newsletter/post **must** link back to at least one Cornerstone Pillar (defined in [BLOG_STRATEGY.md](BLOG_STRATEGY.md)) to pass authority.

> [!TIP]
> **Next Step**: Proceed to [CONTENT_QUEUE.md](CONTENT_QUEUE.md) to begin tracking the 50-post rollout.
